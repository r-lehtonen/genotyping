genotyping and comparison of allele and genotype frequencies
This script automates the calculation of allele and genotypes frequencies,  and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, using the genetics package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/genetics/index.html). 
It also makes a comparison of frequencies between two groups or populations, using the chi-square test and returns a table with the results.
